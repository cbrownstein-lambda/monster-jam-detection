# Monster Jam Detection

## Project Overview
This repository provides code and configuration for training a YOLO object detection model to identify Monster Jam trucks using the Roboflow dataset and MLflow for experiment tracking.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cbrownstein-lambda/monster-jam-detection.git
cd monster-jam-detection
```

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker (for MLflow server)
- Roboflow account and API key
- GPU recommended for training
- Recommended: Use a Python virtual environment (venv) to avoid package conflicts.
- Required Python modules (install with pip):
  - `mlflow`
  - `torch`
  - `ultralytics`
  - `roboflow`

### Set up a Python virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install all required modules:
```bash
pip install -U mlflow torch ultralytics roboflow
```

## 1. Start MLflow Tracking Server
MLflow is used to track experiments and results. The project includes a `mlflow.compose.yaml` for easy setup with Docker Compose.

> **Note for Lambda On-Demand Cloud users:**
> The `ubuntu` user may need to be added to the `docker` group to run Docker commands without `sudo`:
> ```bash
> sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
> # Log out and back in for group changes to take effect
> ```
> Alternatively, you can prefix Docker commands with `sudo`:
> ```bash
> sudo docker compose -f mlflow.compose.yaml up -d
> ```

```bash
# Start MLflow server (from project root)
docker compose -f mlflow.compose.yaml up -d
```
- MLflow UI will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
- Data is stored in a Docker volume (`mlflow_backend`)

## 2. Download the Dataset from Roboflow
Use `download_data.py` to fetch the dataset. You need a Roboflow API key. You can pass it as an argument or set it as an environment variable.

```bash
# Set your Roboflow API key (recommended)
export ROBOFLOW_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Download the dataset (default settings)
python download_data.py

# Custom options:
python download_data.py --api_key your_api_key --workspace cody-brownstein --project monster-jam-detection --version_number 9 --download_format yolov8
```
**Defaults:**
- Workspace: `cody-brownstein`
- Project: `monster-jam-detection`
- Version: `9`
- Format: `yolov8`

The dataset will be downloaded to a folder printed in the output.

> **Note:** Downloaded datasets are expected to be placed in the `datasets/` directory. Make sure your data config path (e.g., `datasets/Monster-Jam-Detection-9/data.yaml`) matches the location of your downloaded dataset.
>
> You can also download the datasets directly from [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/cody-brownstein/monster-jam-detection).

## 3. Train the YOLO Model
Use `train_yolo.py` to start training. MLflow will automatically log parameters and results.

> **Important:** Ensure MLflow logging is enabled in YOLO settings. In Ultralytics YOLO, set `mlflow=True` in your training command or configuration if it's not already enabled. See the [Ultralytics MLflow integration docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/mlflow/) for details.

```bash
# Train with default settings
python train_yolo.py

# Custom options:
python train_yolo.py \
  --tracking_uri http://127.0.0.1:5000 \
  --experiment_name "Monster Jam Detection" \
  --data_config datasets/Monster-Jam-Detection-9/data.yaml \
  --model_name yolo11l.pt \
  --epochs 100 \
  --img_size 640
```
**Defaults:**
- Tracking URI: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
- Experiment Name: `Monster Jam Detection`
- Data Config: `datasets/Monster-Jam-Detection-9/data.yaml`
- Model Name: `yolo11l.pt`
- Epochs: `100`
- Image Size: `640`

## 4. View Results
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser to view experiment runs, metrics, and artifacts.

## Environment Variables
You can set the following environment variables to override defaults:
- `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY`
- `ROBOFLOW_WORKSPACE`
- `ROBOFLOW_PROJECT`
- `ROBOFLOW_VERSION_NUMBER`
- `ROBOFLOW_DOWNLOAD_FORMAT`
- `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME`
